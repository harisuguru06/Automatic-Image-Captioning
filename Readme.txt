Automatic Image captioning
--------------------------------------------
This project contain different model and trained on flicker 8k, 30k for experimental purpose.


ImageCaptionLSTM.ipynb
ImageCaptionLSTM_30K.ipynb
google colab contains Xception model to extract features of image, and LSTM model to form caption of image


TransformerImageCaptionCNN.ipynb
TransformerImageCaptionCNN_30K.ipynb
google colab contains efficientnet architecture to extract features of image, and Transfomer model to form caption of image.


Model_Deployment.ipynb
This note book contains code to deploy model in google colab and accept input from the browser using ngrok. It also shows how to deploy model in flask.


Model Metrics.docx
Metrics for different dataset and different models to evaluate performance.
